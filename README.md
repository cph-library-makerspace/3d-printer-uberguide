# 3D Printer Überguide
Welcome to the 3D Printer Überguide for the Cal Poly Humboldt Library Makerspace. 
This repository serves to document the norms of use and maintenance for our 3D printers, the Ender 3 S1 Pro and Ender 3 S1 Plus, for both students who wish to request a print as well as student assistants who need to clarify or troubleshoot a process with our printers. If there is anything you wish to add, please don't hesitate to open a pull request.

## Submission Norms
### Design Norms
Before you submit a file, either designed yourself or found online, please keep in mind that we use solely FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printers. This means that designs made for SLA (resin) printers often will not come out right because of the detail required to print them. As a general rule of thumb, think to yourself, _can a moving part extruding a 0.4mm line of molten plastic print this?_ If you are unsure, don't hesitate to ask us first. Generally, objects with large unsupported overhangs, hanging parts, unsupported vertical parts, or very thin parts, as well as objects that are very complicated across multiple axes, may not print well. In the case that you are unsure of the printability of your design, please consult us and we can advise you on how you can possibly make your design more robust.
### Naming Conventions
Please make the submission file name descriptive and avoid special characters or spaces. Include your name in the submission file name.
