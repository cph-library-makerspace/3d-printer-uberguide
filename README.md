Welcome to the 3D Printer Ãœberguide for the Cal Poly Humboldt Library Makerspace. This repository serves to document the norms of use and maintenance for our 3D printers, the Ender 3 S1 Pro and Ender 3 S1 Plus, for both students who wish to request a print as well as student assistants who need to clarify or troubleshoot a process with our printers. If there is anything you wish to add, please don't hesitate to open a pull request. This is meant to be a living, evolving resource for this space. The documentation in its current state can be viewed in the `Wiki` tab in this repository.
